Change the url in gather_ios_app_info.rb to whatever the url you generated from http://itunes.apple.com/rss/generator/.
And then just run the script, you'll get what you want.

Application data is written into the yml file in the type of AppInfo class which is defined in the script.
There's another script named read_yaml.rb. Read the code and just run it after you gathered the data, you'll see how to use the yaml file and getting data from it.

That's it.

Cheers.
